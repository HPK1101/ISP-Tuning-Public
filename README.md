### Scripting and code development Process
- For the development process, I use the local folder on Windows to keep the raw files. Installing the GitHub Desktop application seems the easiest way I found.
- The script development is on Colab and online, then the files will be downloaded locally and pushed to GitHub using the GitHub Desktop app.

### Google Drive folder for raw files
- TBD for public access (WIS)
